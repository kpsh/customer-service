## 🤔 Purpose
This software is intended to make the user's experience more accessible and flexible when they need information regarding CIT’s services. The user can ask for solutions to their problem and get fast responses. They can ask a question for a specific topic regarding CIT, receive answers accordingly and if the chatbot cannot answer the question, they can get in contact with a live operator. This software is intended for users that only require an internet connection and administrators that require log in permissions to manage and moderate the web application. Users can easily access the chat, ask a question that they might have and receive their answer instantly. This improves the software's efficiency and ease of use for the user. The goal is to provide CIT students and faculties a quick and easy way to have their questions answered. :smile:
